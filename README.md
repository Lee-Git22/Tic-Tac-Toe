# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a project within The Odin Project's Ruby Course curriculum, the idea is to practice basic OOP principles by creating a tic-tac-toe game that is played through the terminal. 

## How To Play
- Player 1 will start and use X, player 2 will use O
- Select move by entering the number of the position you wish to take in the terminal

## Reflection
After completing this project, I'm not entirely sure how much of it really required the OOP principles I learned in the lessons before hand. I don't think there are many uses for creating multiple instances of any classes to fully utiltize OOP, and so I ended up just creating a `Game` module that holds various game related methods. I might be missing something but I'm not too sure what elements of tic tac toe could be declared as classes and how that would help me. Perhaps the upcoming projects will have more complexity to really make use of OOP principles.
